## Presentation Summary
When SwiftUI was released in 2019, it was launched alongside a declarative framework for processing values over time: Combine.
However, in 2021 we gained access to all-new language features such as async/await that can describe asynchronous and concurrent operations using more synchronous-looking and structured patterns.
In this presentation Richard will walk through building a simple game of Simon using SwiftUI and the new Swift concurrency features to drive asynchronous state changes.
